# django_microservices
This app is used to demonstrate a microservice architecture for a django based app. To install django use:
```
pip install django
pip install djangorestframework
```
The application also used [REACT FRAMEWORK](https://reactjs.org/) for its frontend. The application communicates using [RABBITMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html). We use docker container to deploy and ship the application. To learn more about docker and its usage, follow [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
